## Biweekly meetings
The CCB typically meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss Open CCB items, especially Change Requests and Solution Proposals, though actual in-depth discussion on each issue may happen separately. These issues correlate to existing GitHub items on this repo and are used to track progress and discussions. The Link to these meetings will be posted here, one week before the meetings.
